Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Feel your pain, you feel mine
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
I just want to be just like you
"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn"
So why don't you all sit down?
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Feel your pain, you feel mine
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you so
But I already told you my whole life story
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Feel your pain, you feel mine
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Just stay true to you, yeah, so...
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes
To fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful
